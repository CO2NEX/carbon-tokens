## 🌍 About CO2NEX & C2NX Tokens

**CO2NEX** is building the world’s first real-time, transparent carbon credit verification system — integrating AI, satellite data, blockchain, and a decentralized network of human validators.

**C2NX** is the native token of the platform — enabling:

- ✅ Incentives for accurate carbon credit verification
- 🧾 Fees for certification and marketplace interactions
- 🗳 On-chain governance of the protocol
- 📊 Staking and slashing to ensure trust and accountability

Together, CO2NEX and C2NX are laying the foundation for **auditable, accessible, and transparent carbon markets**.

## 🧱 Real-Time Carbon Credit Tracking

C2NX is not just a utility token — it’s a **verification incentive engine** that powers:

- 🌐 Real-time tracking of carbon sequestration and emissions
- 🛰 Satellite and IoT data anchoring to immutable smart contracts
- 🧑‍💼 Human validator bounties for data accuracy and impact confirmation
- 📡 Integration-ready APIs for climate projects and developers

> With C2NX, carbon data moves from fragmented reports to **live blockchain-confirmed streams**.

## 🧮 Tokenomics (Draft Overview)

| Metric                     | Detail                             |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Max Supply                 | 1,000,000,000 C2NX                  |
| Initial Distribution       | 20% Ecosystem, 25% DAO Treasury, 15% Validators, 10% Dev Grants, 30% Protocol Reserves |
| Inflation Rate             | Dynamic (based on validator activity) |
| Governance                 | 1 C2NX = 1 vote                     |
| Staking                    | Mandatory for validator eligibility |
| Slashing                   | Yes – for false or malicious activity |
